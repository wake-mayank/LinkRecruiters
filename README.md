### **Installation & Setup**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/wake-mayank/LinkRecruiters.git
    cd LinkRecruiters
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (in the `/backend` directory):**

      * Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
      * Create and activate a virtual environment:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
      * Install Python dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
      * Set up environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory by copying the example file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
      * Fill in the required values in your new `.env` file (Database URL, Secret Key, etc.).
      * Run database migrations:
        ```bash
        # Example for Django:
        python manage.py migrate
        # Example for Flask with Alembic:
        flask db upgrade
        ```

3.  **Frontend Setup (in the `/frontend` directory):**

      * Navigate to the frontend directory from the root folder:
        ```bash
        cd ../frontend
        ```
      * Install npm dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
      * Create a `.env.local` file by copying the example:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env.local
        ```
      * Update the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env.local` to point to your backend server (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### **Running the Development Servers**

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**

      * In the `/backend` directory (with the virtual environment activated):
        ```bash
        # Example for FastAPI with Uvicorn:
        uvicorn app.main:app --reload

        # Example for Django:
        python manage.py runserver
        ```
      * The backend will be live at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Application:**

      * In the `/frontend` directory:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
      * The frontend application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port specified by Vite/Create React App).
